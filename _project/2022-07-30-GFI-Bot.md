A GFI-Bot introduction paper is available as follows (submitted to [ESEC/FSE 2022 Demonstration Track](https://2022.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2022-demonstrations)):

The underlying ML approach is introduced in the following paper:

In Proceedings of the 44th International Conference on Software Engineering, ICSE 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, May 21â€“29, 2022. ACM. [https://hehao98.github.io/files/2022-recgfi.pdf](https://hehao98.github.io/files/2022-recgfi.pdf)

We provide a good first issue recommendation dataset at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6665931).

## Get Started

GFI-Bot is available at [https://gfibot.io](https://gfibot.io), where you can browse through existing good first issue recommendations or register your own repository for recommendation. GFI-Bot can be installed in GitHub repositories from [the GitHub App page](https://github.com/apps/GFI-Bot).

**NOTE: GFI-Bot is currently in pre-alpha stage. It is undergoing rapid development and still highly unstable. We cannot guanrantee the preseveration of registered users and repositories in the next release and it may have unexpected behaviors on GitHub. We will change this note after GFI-Bot reaches a certain level of maturity**

## Roadmap

We describe our envisioned use cases for GFI-Bot in this [documentation](https://github.com/osslab-pku/gfi-bot/blob/main/USE_CASES.md).

Currently, we are focusing on the following tasks:
1. Identifying an optimal training strategy
2. Improving user experience

## Development

More development details are available at [https://github.com/osslab-pku/gfi-bot](https://github.com/osslab-pku/gfi-bot)
