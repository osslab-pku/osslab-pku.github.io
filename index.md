## Introduction

We are a research group at School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University. 

In the broadest sense, our research belongs to the Software Engineering field, which focuses on improving the **efficiency** and **quality** of software development. The software engineering community is diversed in all sorts of ways toward this goal. We often take the **empirical** approach, by observing things in real life and summarizing best practices from experiences. 

More specifically, our current focus is on observing software repositories and measuring how developers live their lives for various purposes, like helping understand and control large complex software systems, society, and universe. We might use a wide spectrum of technologies and interdisplinary methodologies, depending on the specific problem we are tackling with. 

See [the CCF list](https://www.ccf.org.cn/Academic_Evaluation/TCSE_SS_PDL/) for top venues in this field. See [Publications](/publications/) for our latest publications. If you want to learn more, see [Resources](/resources/) in this website.

## Current Research Ts

1. Profiling Developer (expertise and personality)
2. Open Source Sustainbility
3. Structure/characteristics of open source ecosystem (Company Participation)
4. Open Source Software Supply Chain
5. Mining AI Software Trends
6. Enhancing Source Code Comments
7. Software engineering bots (GFI recommender/dependency update bot/release note bot...)

## For Prespective Students

We are constantly looking for self-motivated students with sufficient programming skills. Students with strong interest in mining big data, observing open source ecosystems and improving current software development practices are extremely welcomed. Industry experiences and rich software development skills will be your great advantage. Background in software engineering, statistics, visualization, data mining, machine learning and natural language processing might help you prosper in this field but are not necessarily required.
