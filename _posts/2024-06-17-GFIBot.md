[GFI-Bot](https://github.com/osslab-pku/gfi-bot) has been showcased on the official website of the [GH Archive project](https://www.gharchive.org/#resources). 

GH Archive is a project dedicated to documenting and archiving the public timeline of GitHub, capturing the work activities of open-source developers worldwide for further analysis. The GH Archive dataset is extensively utilized for research pertaining to open-source projects. 

GFI-Bot, developed by OSS-Lab, is a machine learning-powered bot designed to identify and categorize good first issues within GitHub projects. Accessible through a user-friendly [WebApp interface](https://gfibot.io/), users can browse through existing good first issue recommendations or register their own repository for recommendation.
