The 30th IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER 2023) was held in Macao SAR, China from March 21st to 24th. Two Ph.D. students from our research group, Haiqiao Gu and Jianyu Wu, presented their research findings in the "Open Source Software Ecosystem" and "Mining Software Repositories" sessions, respectively.

Haiqiao Gu's paper presented a large-scale comparative study on self-admitted library migrations (SALMs) across three ecosystems using an accurate approach to the identification of SALMs. The study verified previous results and revealed insights about the development of software package ecosystems. Jianyu Wu's paper characterized software release notes (RNs) from the dimensions of structure, writing style, and content, and discussed how to generate practical and informative RNs.

Both reports received unanimous recognition and enthusiastic response from the audience.
