ðŸ“¢ *[LicenseRec V2.0.0](https://licenserec.com) is officially launched! New features include compliance analysis accurate to package versions and license incompatibility remediation based on SMT-Solver!*
LicenseRec is a license compliance analysis and open-source license recommendation tool that helps developers perform compliance analysis and select the optimal license for their open-source software projects.

LicenseRec conducts fine-grained license compliance analysis on the code and dependencies (including direct and indirect dependencies) of open-source software projects. For incompatibility cases, it provides a minimum-cost incompatibility remediation solution using a constraint-solving based method. The compliance analysis and incompatibility remediation functions can be accessed at [https://licenserec.com/#/compliance](https://licenserec.com/#/compliance).

Based on the compliance analysis, LicenseRec helps developers choose the best license through an interactive wizard. This wizard provides guidance in three aspects: personal open-source style, business model, and community development. The recommendation function can be used at [https://licenserec.com/#/rec](https://licenserec.com/#/rec).
